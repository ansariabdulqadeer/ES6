        //1. react is single page application means its uses index.html page only to display front end and also its not reloading 
        //the page when we move one link to other.
        // React.js is a javascript library which is used to building beutifull user interface

        //2. whatever we write inside {1+2} this is a javascript.

        //3. jsx(javasript syntax extension):its a mixture of html and javascript

        //4. component: we can break react js project in component like header component, footer component,left side component
        // and main component so its easy to manage the big project.


        //5. props: by using props we can send the data from one component to another component
        //props is a javascript object which pass from parent component to child component.
        //two types of props i. Prop Types  ii. Defaults prop

        //i. PropTypes: here we can define the props type like eg string, number,bool etc so if you pass other then it will give error message
        //eg. Header.PropsTypes={
        //     title:PropTypes.string,      //that means whatever we pass in header component it should be a string
        //     searchbar:PropTypes.bool
        // }

        // ii. defaultProps: by using default props we can provide default props so if we forget to pass then it will take default props.
        //eg.
        // header.defaultProps={
        //     title:"your search bar",
        //     searchbar:true
        // }

        //6. Routing: by using routing we can navigate one page to another page without reloading the page.

        //7. state: by using react state we can access the user data.

        //8. difference between npm and npx
        //nmp:besically when we install through npm then its install permanently
        //npx: when we install by using npx then we just used it its not install permanently.


        //9. about react files
        //package.json:here all project dependecy istalled
        //Reademe.md : its use to push the code on git hub
        //.gitignore: which we don't want to push on git hub
        //public: its a public folder where we keep images,icon etc but there is our main file index.html
        //index.html: its our main file beacuse whole application run on this file thats why we called react is single page application.
        // index.js :Its a entry point of our react application 
        //app.js: app.js is our main component where we can inject css and all related components
