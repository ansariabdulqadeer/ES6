        //1.difference between javascript and node js
        // i.javascript:javascript is a programming language and it is used for client side activity for a web application.
        // ii.Node.js: Nodejs is a javascript run time environment which is used for run the javascript code on server side, 
        // accessing or performing any non-blocking operation of any operating system.
         
        //2.what is node.js
        // i.node js is a javascript run time which is execute the javascript code on server side, accessing or performing any
        //  non blocking operation of any operating system.
        // ii. It is built on chrome's v8 thats why it is very fast. it is directly compile javascript code on native machine.
        
        // 3. why nodejs / major benifits of using node.js
        // nodjs runs single threaded non-blocking asyncronusly programing and very memory efficient simple and fast, no-bufferng 
        // and open source.


        // 4. why node js is single threaded 
        // i. nodejs uses single threaded model in order to support async processing.
        // ii. with async processing, an applicaiton can perform better and more scallable under web loads.

        //5. how do nodejs works / Architecture of node.js
        //i. it works on single threaded event-loop and non-blocking i/o which can handle higher number of concurrent requests.
        //ii. By using http module nodejs can run on any stand-alone web server.

        // 6. where nodejs can be used
        // i. nodejs can be used real-time web application ii. it can be used network applincation and distributed system 
        // and obiously general purpose application.

        // 7. How many types of API  functions are there in node.js
        // i. Asynchronus non-blocking functions
        // ii. Synchronus blocking functions

        // 8. what is the difference between Asynchronous and non blocking
        // i. we can make asynchronous http request that do not wait for the server to respond.
        // ii. It continue to respond to the request  for which it has already received the server response.
        //it execute the code simulteniously  eg.setTimeout

        // i. non-blocking used regards i/o operations.
        // ii. They immediately respond wahtever data is available and keep running as per the request.

        // 9. what is package.json
        // It is the heart of the entire application.
        // ii. It contains the meta data of the project where we can define the properties of the package.

        // 10.what do you understand by Event-driven programming
        // Event driven programming is a programmming approach that makes use of events for triggering various function.
        //Event driven programming makes use of besically two concepts
        // i. Event handler:call back function that is called when event is triggered
        // ii. there will be  main loop which liten for event triggered so its called the associated event handler for that event.


        //11. what is event loop in nodejs and how does it work
        // i. It handles all asynchronous callback in an application.
        //ii. simply event loop has one job it is monitor the call stack and callback que if the call stack is empty then its 
        //    take the first event from the que. eg setTimeOut

        //12. what is REPL in the context of nodejs
        //  REPL stands for read evaluate print loop basicallly it is like we are print javascript code on console similerly
        //  we can run nodejs code on command so its called REPL 
        //  R: is read and E: means evaluate or process and p: print final out put and L: its loop when we pressed ctrl+c twice 
        //  then we can come out from loop.

        // 13. List down the tasks which should be done asynchronusly using event loop
        //     Input output operations   => Heavy computations      =>Blocking operations

        // 14. what do you understand by test pyramid
        // Unit Tests    =>   Integration Tests    =>  End To End
        // i. unint tests: In unit test we can individual functions which is very fast
        // ii. Integration Tests:  In integration test we can one module and their dependency
        // iii. End to End :  here we can test complete system from top to bottem 

        //15. what is error first call back in nodejs
        //error and success
        // if(err){
        //     
        // }
        //i.in node js error is fixed callback if error come return it
        //ii. if no error return success response


        // 16.Explain the purpose of module.exports
        // module in node.js is used to encapsulate all related data into single unit which is used to shift from one page to 
        //another by import  
        //here module is a variable and expots is a object which is expose as a module

        // 17. what is reactor pattern in nodejs 
        // reacter pattern is a concept of non-blocking i/o operation 
        // it helps to generation of the event queue in node.js

        //18. what is difference between font-end and back-end
        // i. front end refers to the user interface or whatever user see on the browser called front end 
        // eg html,css and javascript
        // ii.  backend means server,application and database that works behind the scene to deliver information to the user

        //19. list down major security implementation within node.js
        //i. Authentication:  JWT token
        // ii. Error handling:  

        //20. callback hell
        // :callback hell simply we can call back multiple which are depends each other called callback hell.
        //when javascript developer try to execute multiple asyncrnous operations one after another which is hard to read and debug. 


        //21. Explain libuv
        // libuv is a nodejs library which is used for asynchronous i/o operation and high performance server

        // 22. Middleware
        // Middleware is a function which has access request and response objects
        // like eg if you want any user can't visit particular page whithout login and registration then we are using middleware.
        // simple we are using next().

        //23. list down the arguments that async.queue takes as input
        // Task funciton and concurrency value

        // 24. difference between spawn() and fork() methods in node.js
        //i. The spawn() method is used to launch the new process which provided set of commands
        //ii. fork is sub set mehod of spawn() that execute the new instance of the V8 engine.

        //25. what is express.js package:
        // Express.js is a lightweight and flexible framework of node.js that management data-flow between server and routes 
        // in the server-side applications.

        //26. Ajax
        // Ajax is a client side technology 
        // it is widely used to updating or modifying the web page content without refresh the page.
        
        
        //27.What is REST api 
        // Rest Api (application programming interface)that uses http request to get,put,post and delete data  
        // By using REST api we can access the data in json and xml foramt 

        //28.callback
        //Callback function: Any function that is passed as an argument to another function called callback function.
        // A callback function can run after another function has finished.   

        // fun1=(name,test)=>{
        //     console.log(name);
        //     test();
        // }

        // fun2=()=>{
        //     console.log("hello");
        // }
        // fun1("abdul",fun2)

        //29.Promises in javascript
        // A promises is an object that may produce a single value some times in the future: either resolved or rejected
        //eg. we request data from the server if there is any network error then it will reject and if there is no error then resolve.
    //    let trst=new Promise((res,rej)=>{
    //     setTimeout(()=>{
    //         let name="abdul";
    //         res(name);
    //     },8000)
    //    });

    //    trst.then((something)=>{
    //         console.log(something);
    //    }).catch((test)=>{
    //     console.log(test);
    //    })
       //30. local  storage vs session vs cookie
       //Local storage: Local storage are permanently its space is 5 to 10mb it only delete by using localStrage.clear()
                        // its support client side only.
       //session: Session storage validy only same tab if we open new tab then its destroyed and its storage 5mb its 
                 //support client side only.
       //cookie: Cookie storage we can set manualy expiry date its storage 5kb its support client and server side

       //31. json
       //json stands for javascript object notation
       //It is widedly used to send the data from server to web page. it light weight
       //it is language independent 


    //32.  session and cookies
    //session are stored in server side and it is more secure then the cookie becuase it store the data in server side.
    //when we login then it create session id which is stored in cookie when we logout then session destroyed.
    //cookie is a browser side storage and we can stored limited data in cookie and it is less secure
